// JAVASCRIPT:

// A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR THE WEB

// AN INTERPRETED LANGUAGE (WEB SCRIPTING LANGUAGE)

// JUST A BROWSER OR NODEJS AND IN SOME SPECIAL CASES BOTH ARE NEEDED
// TO RUN JAVASCRIPT PROGRAMS.

// .js IS THE FILE EXTENSION i.e app.js,index.js

JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the
Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other
major graphical web browsers.(NO ONE MENTIONS THAT IT WAS CREATED IN 10 DAYS 
BY BRENDAN EITCH) 
10 DAYS??? 
    To JavaScript—you weren’t born with a silver spoon in
    your mouth, but you’ve outclassed every language that’s
    challenged you in the browser. ~~ HEAD FIRST JAVASCRIPT

After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written
to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various
pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking
about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the
Ecma International organization that did the standardization. In practice, the
terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably—they are two
names for the same language.

We mainly use JavaScript to create
    websites
    web applications
    server-side applications using Node.js
but JavaScript is not limited to these things, and it can also be used to
create mobile applications using tools like React Native
create programs for microcontrollers and the internet of things
create smartwatch applications
It can basically do anything. It's so popular that everything new that shows up
is going to have some kind of JavaScript integration at some point.

JavaScript is a programming language that is:
high level: it provides abstractions that allow you to ignore the details of
    the machine where it's running on. It manages memory automatically with
    a garbage collector, so you can focus on the code instead of managing
    memory like other languages like C would need, and provides many
    constructs which allow you to deal with highly powerful variables and
    objects.
dynamic: opposed to static programming languages, a dynamic language
    executes at runtime many of the things that a static language does at
    compile time. This has pros and cons, and it gives us powerful features
    like dynamic typing, late binding, reflection, functional programming,
    object runtime alteration, closures and much more. Don't worry if those
    things are unknown to you - you'll know all of those at the end of the
    course.
dynamically typed: a variable does not enforce a type. You can reassign
    any type to a variable, for example, assigning an integer to a variable that
    holds a string.
loosely typed: as opposed to strong typing, loosely (or weakly) typed
    languages do not enforce the type of an object, allowing more flexibility
    but denying us type safety and type checking (something that TypeScript -
    which builds on top of JavaScript - provides)
interpreted: it's commonly known as an interpreted language, which
    means that it does not need a compilation stage before a program can
    run, as opposed to C, Java or Go for example. In practice, browsers do
    compile JavaScript before executing it, for performance reasons, but this
    is transparent to you: there is no additional step involved.
multi-paradigm:the language does not enforce any particular
    programming paradigm, unlike Java for example, which forces the use of
    object-oriented programming, or C that forces imperative programming.
    You can write JavaScript using an object-oriented paradigm, using
    prototypes and the new (as of ES6) classes syntax. You can write
    JavaScript in a functional programming style, with its first-class functions,
    or even in an imperative style (C-like).
